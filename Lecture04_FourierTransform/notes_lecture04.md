### Filtering in the frequency Domain

* **High-Pass Filter**
    * Using this filter, only the transitions remains.
    * Anything related to higher frequencies abrupt transitions.
    * So, by removing the lower frequencies, the more abrupt transitions are seen in more detail in the resulting image.

* **Low-Pass Filter**
    * Does the opposite from the High-Pass Filter
    * Removing the higher frequencies removes the abrupt transitions.
    * So, the resulting image has smoother transitions, but the more abrupt ones are lost.

* **Band-Stop Filter**
    * Is usually used to remove interference in a given frequence value.
