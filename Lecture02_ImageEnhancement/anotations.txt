image with less intensity of grey levels => lower contrast

Logarithm alteration:
    |-> Due to the logarithm function's nature, it shrinks the dynamic range.
        |-> the dark levels of the input pixel are mapped into brighter ones, and the medium-bright are shrinked to a lower and brighter range


Gamma adjustment operation:
    |-> Its behaviour changes depending wether \gamma > 1

Thresholding
    |-> it gives a binary image
    |-> Let L be the threshold. T(z) = 1 if z > L, T(z) = 0 otherwise
